This site was created as a portofolio from Angela Yu's Udemy [Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp) WDBC.

This repository was built to deal with the github pages not being able to find the index.html file in subdirectories of the [WDBC](https://github.com/mcaiox/WDBC) repository.
